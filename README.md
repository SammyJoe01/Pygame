# **Pygame**
This repository contains nine Pygame examples that demonstrate different aspects of Pygame game development. Each example is contained in a separate Python file and can be run independently.

### **Example 1: Hello World**
This is a simple Pygame program that displays a window and prints out any events that occur.
When you run the program, it will create a window with the title "Hello World". The window will be 600 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall.
The program will then enter a main game loop, which continually checks for events that occur. If any events occur, they will be printed to the console.
To exit the program, simply click the "X" button in the top right corner of the window. This will generate a pygame.QUIT event, which will cause the program to exit the main game loop and terminate.

### **Example 2/3/4:  Drawing and Graphics**
1. Drawing Objects:

This program demonstrates how to draw shapes on the screen, including lines, circles, and rectangles. The program creates a window with a blue background and draws several shapes in different colors and sizes.
To exit the program, simply click the "X" button in the top right corner of the window. This will generate a pygame.QUIT event, which will cause the program to exit the main game loop and terminate.

2. Blitting Images:

This program demonstrates how to load and blit images on the screen. The program creates a window with two dragon images and a line in between them. The dragons face each other and the line separates them.
To exit the program, simply click the "X" button in the top right corner of the window. This will generate a pygame.QUIT event, which will cause the program to exit the main game loop and terminate.

3. Blitting Text:

This program demonstrates how to render and blit text on the screen using different fonts. The program creates a window with two text strings in different fonts and colors.
To exit the program, simply click the "X" button in the top right corner of the window. This will generate a pygame.QUIT event, which will cause the program to exit the main game loop and terminate.

### **Example 5: Adding Sounds**
The adding_sounds.py file demonstrates how to load and play sound effects and background music using the Pygame mixer module. It also shows how to change the volume of a sound effect.

### **Example 6: Discrete Movement**
The discrete_movement.py file shows how to move an image (in this case, a dragon) in discrete steps using the arrow keys. The dragon moves left, right, up, and down by a fixed velocity each time an arrow key is pressed.

### **Example 7: Mouse Movement**
The mouse_movement.py file shows how to move an image (again, a dragon) using mouse events. The dragon follows the mouse when the left mouse button is clicked, and it continues to follow the mouse as long as the button is held down.

### **Example 8: Continuous Movement**
The continuous_movement.py file shows how to move an image (yep, you guessed it, a dragon) continuously using the arrow keys. The dragon moves left, right, up, and down at a fixed velocity as long as the corresponding arrow key is held down. The dragon stops at the borders of the screen.

### **Example 9: Collision Detection**
This Pygame example demonstrates how to detect collisions between two objects and respond accordingly. In this case, the objects are a dragon (controlled by the player) and a coin that moves randomly around the screen.
Use the arrow keys to move the dragon around the screen. The goal is to collect as many coins as possible by colliding with them. Each time the dragon collides with a coin, it will disappear and reappear at a random location on the screen.
